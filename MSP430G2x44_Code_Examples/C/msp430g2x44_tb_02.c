 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G2x44 Demo - Timer_B, Toggle P1.0, TBCCR0 Up Mode ISR, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software and TB0 ISR. Timer_B is
//  configured for up mode, thus the timer overflows when TBR counts
//  to TBCCR0. In this example, TBCCR0 is loaded with 20000.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = TBCLK = default DCO ~1.2MHz
